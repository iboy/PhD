\f0\fs36 \cf0 *Digital Puppetry* is a hybrid art form that includes a broad range of creative practices. The current chapter explores real-time video montages and avatar control using wireless game controllers while exploring what is meant by the term *digital puppet* and raises issues surrounding the virtual and tangible body in performance. Real-time media objects are viewed as *extensions* to the human performer -- sympathetic with the traditions and conventional definitions of puppetry.\
\
I document the workings of a prototype performance system made using Apple's innovative and free development tool *Quartz Composer*. It encompasses screen-based digital puppetry and scenography, *mixed-reality* video composites and custom software programming and the gestural control of an on-screen avatar using the popular game controller, the Nintendo *Wii-remote*.\
