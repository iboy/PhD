\f0\fs36 \cf0 Using *Quartz Composer*, I created a monster control patch ([][#fig:figure_015_total_QC_to_wii_patch], at the end of this document), that includes a *Wii-Remote* controlled avatar patch, and also allowed MIDI controlled sequencing of the scenography, special effects and character and avatar control, The monster patch included sub-patches that performed the following tasks: (i) hooks to integrate incoming data from the Nintendo *Wii-Remote*, (ii) chroma-keying using a core image kernel (written in *Open-GL Shader Language* -- *GLSL*) and (iii) *Quartz Composer* patches for MIDI connectivity and keyboard control of screen objects and sequencing scenography.\
