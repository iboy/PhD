Karaghiozi in Albania: 1940\
The epic of the Albanian campaign was of decisive importance in modern Greek history.\
During that campaign, the Greeks demonstrated their faith in liberty and the ideals of their race - the ideals on which they had been nurtured for generation after generation. Greece decided to fight in October 1940, when Italy declared war on it, and despite the enormous difficulties was victorious over the forces of autocracy and Fascism. The message the Greeks sent out at that time was one of Liberty, Democracy and the right of all mankind, values which are deeply rooted in the soul of every Greek - and, of course, of Karaghiozi. }
