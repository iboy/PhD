\f0\fs36 \cf0 Often talking toys become extensions of pre-existing media thatproject ideas outwards, from toy to child, rather than being empty vessels that facilitate projection from child to toy. This is particularly acute in any toy that represents known characters from other media productions, the huge so-called *character toy* market. \

What difference does it make if the imaginary topic of make-believe style play with talking toys is sourced from existing media,rather created from within than the child herself? \

Justine Cassell creates story environments and interactive objectsto research the quality of technology assisted spontaneous play and story creation. In [Cassell and Ryokai (Last Modified: 2001. Date Accessed: 01/03/2007)][#Cassell:2007uq], Cassell carefully documents and quantifies the generative, creative effects of certain (I would call *dialogical*) interactive technologies. Using quantitative and visualisation methods, she carefully annotates the original spontaneous vocal contributions offered by children while playing with interactive toys. She also transcribes and qualitatively analyses the text of stories children create using her *environment*.}
