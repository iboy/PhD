\f0\fs36 \cf0 Using Xcode, Apple's free developers environment, software was developed that used open source libraries to connect wirelessly via bluetooth to the Nintendo *Wii-Remote*. The *Wii-Remote* is a wireless pointer device and accelerometer that can detect motion and rotation in quasi 3D space. It has a numerous buttons, including a cursor pad. Wonderfully customisable, the *Wii-Remote* would control the movement, the pitch and roll and the eye movements of an avatar within the *Open-GL* 3D space of *Quartz Composer*. I called this software *QCWii*.\
\
*QCWii* currently has the following functionality: (i) full screen capabilities for the embedded *Quartz Composer* composition -- essential for projecting the results, (ii) a set of preferences controlling the *Wii-Remote* sensitivity, key mapping, scene sequencing and order configuration, color choices and more and (iii) Connectivity to the Nintendo *Wii-Remote* Controller ideal for virtual puppet control.\
