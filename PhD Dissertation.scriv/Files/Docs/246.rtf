Apple's *Quartz Composer* is indebted to experimental analogue video of the 1970s and 1980s -- where physical patch based video synthesisers and multiplexers were used to process real-time analogue video and do things like blue-screening, chroma-keying, vision-mixing and other visual effects. Such technology today is emulated in software and inspires digital creatives from visualists and VJs [Faulkner (2006)][#Faulkner:2006qy] to multimedia performers like Robert LePage (see *The Far Side of the Moon*[^ChQCLepage]) and Laurie Anderson (see her recent work as NASA's artist in residence[^CHQCAnderson]). The influence of early video processing has resonated through and been reanimated by  recent advances in computer graphics processing unit (GPU) capabilities. \

Visual programming software applications like *Quartz Composer*, Cycling 74's *max/msp*[^ChQCMax] and Troikatronix's *Isadora*[^ChQCIsodora] (named after dancer Isadora Duncan) have brought real-time 3D graphics and video processing into the hands of the wider performing arts community.\

To place my explorations in a wider context -- one could call it an exploration in *augmented reality*. From Wikipedia: \
\
: "Augmented reality (AR) is a field of computer research which deals with the combination of real world and computer generated data (in real time). At present, most AR research is concerned with the use of live video imagery which is digitally processed and augmented by the addition of computer generated graphics." [Wikipedia Community (2009)][#Community:2009er]\

The concept of real-time is crucial in the context of performance. There are huge semiotic differences between the live and recorded arts. I am exploring the dialectic between the improvisational and the composed (in other words *planned* or *sequenced*). Real-time computer media will help open up more improvisation space for the media artist. I think this is expressed through a varying number of channels: e.g. performance systems, improvisation while coding, while editing video or music, through playing with new styles of UI or interaction systems. Computer power and the ethos of cinematic interfaces drive us towards very playful systems. See Jeff Han's recent work [(Han, 2009)][#Han:fj] on haptic interfaces and multi-touch surfaces -- particularly the shadow puppet-like drawing with forward kinematics -- for a brilliant demonstration of an improvisational control system[^ChQCHan]\

Apple's *Quartz Composer* allows the use of MIDI control signals and other input data in a straightforward way. I have designed my digital puppet and scenographic space to allow elements of playful interaction that do not involve a conventional screen-based user interface, but are sequenced using wireless game controllers and MIDI decks. The movement of my digital character is tied to the real-time gestural possibilities of a consumer level haptic device.\

Computer media, historically tied up with *un-dynamic* or stored media, is tending towards responsive, data-aware and dynamic systems. To clarify (and expand): \
\
: "The impossibility of technologically processing data in real time is the possibility of art... As long as processing in real time was not available, data always had to be stored intermediately somewhere -- on skin, wax, clay, stone, papyrus, linen, paper, wood, or on the cerebral cortex -- in order to be transmitted or otherwise processed. ..." [Sieger cited Gere (2006), 26][#Gere:2006lr]. \
\
Gere extends this nicely: "Art exists only within a certain *economy* of time produced by the materiality and temporality of culture's means of inscription, storage and exchange." [Gere (2006), 26][#Gere:2006lr]. *Quartz Composer* is one such environment that is tending towards complex, interactive real-time media production.}
