\f0\fs36 \cf0 Error 2 on bibtex\
\
make sure the base tex file is in the correct relationship to the main bib.\
I've not seen this error before. And it took a while to fix. Just make sure the tex file is in a subdirectory at Dissertation Builds. The presence of images creates a different subdirectory level.\
