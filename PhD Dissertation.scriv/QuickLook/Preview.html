For Geert Lovink, "media archaeology is first and foremost a methodology, a hermeneutic reading of the 'new' against the grain of the past, rather than a telling of the histories of technologies from past to present" (2003, 11). <br/>

For Erkki Huhtamo, it is "the study of the cyclically recurring elements and motives underlying and guiding the development of media culture," and "the 'excavation' of the ways in which these discursive traditions and formulations have been 'imprinted' ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>This chapter will outline developing trends and scenarios where talking and listening to the speech of humanoid and non humanoid objects, toys, robots is a part of play and other imaginative work. Working from an expertise in puppetry, automata and the emerging new field of *digital puppetry*, the author will (eventually) take concepts from many disciplines, embedded computing, voice synthesis, performance studies and educational drama (metaxis[^chccmetaxis], role-play, absorption, projection, p...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>: "Do dolls have souls? All children talk to their toys, says Charles Baudelaire, and *the overriding desire of most children is to get at and see the soul of their toys*. Rainer Maria Rilke would agree, with the difference that his child expects the doll to answer back and is disgusted when it doesn't." [Parry (1994), v][#Parry:1994vn]<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Key Questions</strong><br/>**About trends:**<br/>
<br/>
What are the trends in the interaction design of *innovative* toys that embed digital speech technologies? <br/>
How is digitised speech used in contemporary toys? <br/>
How are talking toys used to create narrative based experiences?<br/>
What happens when talking toys automatically move or have facial animation?<br/>
<br/>
**About play:**<br/>

What happens to imaginative play and art when *things* speak? <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.3.1 Scope</strong><br/>In researching this chapter, I have uncovered a quantity of talking technology issues and experiments, both historical and contemporary, that will be discussed in following papers. These include the role of talking technology and objects in education; patents and animatronics in the techno-entertainment industries, linguistic and semantic modelling in a-life simulations and screen-based games, experiments in analogue and digital voice synthesis in computer games and chat-bots and the like, and, ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ten Emerging Ideas Involving Talking Toys And Technology </strong><br/>* Embedding talking technology in toys is more about control than play or exploratory learning. <br/>
* Talking toys are first technological experiments, second, playthings. <br/>
* Talking toys are monologic rather than dialogic. <br/>
* Talking character-based toys, that are dependent on other media, are derivative and closed narrative systems. <br/>
* Talking Toys represent an adult intervention into child-play. <br/>
* What talking toys say is more important than how they say it. <br/>
* Talking toys are of greater value...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.1 Embedding talking technology in toys and Control</strong><br/>Puppetry, the emerging forms of digital puppetry and puppet like talking toys are all about *control* in two important senses. There's the good old fashioned sense that such toys are 'cybernetic' systems where there is a feedback loop with the *movement -- action -- operator/audience* communication chain and in the sense that such toys embed pedagogical rules and structures. <br/>
<br/>
: "The thing about playing is always the precariousness of the interplay of personal psychic reality and control of actu...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.2 Toys as technological experiments</strong><br/>The history of talking toys and automata is clearly a story of technical innovation and development for the purposes of celebration, entertainment and play. According to Jasia Reichardt talking statues have been known since 2500 BC: <br/>
<br/>
: "Some incorporated concealed speaking trumpets through which someone hidden could address a gathering. The idea was that gods communicateed through the statues which represented them" [(Reichardt (1978), 9)][#Reichardt:1978qy]<br/>
<br/>
Of interest here, Jacques de Vaucan...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.3 Monologic and dialogic interaction</strong><br/>Talking toys are rarely conversational agents, and interaction is heavily pre-determined. Randomising responses is one strategy that provides an illusion of knowing, active or predictive conversation. Such illusions are broken when the pattern or repetition is noticed.<br/>
 <br/>
Arguably, talking toys fix patterns and structure play and are, in nature, didactic and instructional. However, structured or programmatic experiences are crucial to learning, play and language development. I am not simply dismi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.4 Talking character-based toys</strong><br/>Often talking toys become extensions of pre-existing media thatproject ideas outwards, from toy to child, rather than being empty vessels that facilitate projection from child to toy. This is particularly acute in any toy that represents known characters from other media productions, the huge so-called *character toy* market. <br/>
<br/>
What difference does it make if the imaginary topic of make-believe style play with talking toys is sourced from existing media,rather created from within than the child ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.5 Adult interventions into child-play</strong><br/>First, adults buy toys and design toys, and their associated pedagogy, for children. Children of a certain age exert pressure and express desires for certain toys, stoked by the marketing messages of the larger toy companies. Most talking toys enshrine messages and pedagogy from adults to children and on occasion seek to replace or act as surrogates for social parental contact: A selling point of a recent the UK designed toy, iTeddy, a strange *Tellie-Tubbies* and iPod hybrid, a bear with a medi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.6 What talking toys say: conversation analysis</strong><br/>Talking toys enshrine a pedagogy that has, in effect, remained un-changed since Edison's *talking doll* of the late 19th Century'. The pedagogy is built on cautionary tales and stories, wrote learning of nursery songs and instruction led play. <br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in this paper, I have mentioned Microsoft's Actimate *Barney the Dinosaur* being accused of lying - mainly because he doesn't have a consciousness yet talks freely of love. The ideological function of what talking dolls say is critical when eva...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.7 Programmable and conﬁgurable talking toys </strong><br/>Talking toys are of greater value when they are programmable and configurable by children </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>5.4.8 Animated facial mechanisms</strong><br/>Animated facial mechanisms attempt to re-embody dis-embodied voice and, in turn, over-concretise and limit imaginative play <br/>
<br/>
: "Phenomenologically, there is a close relationship between the voice and the face; both the voice and the face are parts of us that are turned outwards and by which the world knows us, but which we can ourselves only see or hear partially. They signify intimacy and vulnerability. We are our faces and we are our voices . " (Conner, 2000, 401) [4] <br/>

[Currell (2007)][#currell07]<br/>
<br/>
The domain of puppetry is a broad area and reflects performance and artefacts of vastly variated form and style.<br/>
<br/>
Animated objects or things, and bringing an illusion of agency or life-likeness,  is at the heart of all puppetry. Live control of performing objects and the co-presence of the operator / puppeteer is also key to most established definitions of the puppet.

Computer vision for gesture recognition, touch surfaces (like the Apple's iPhone, Microsoft's Surface and TUIO systems), wireless control devices, accelerometers and game control devices, like data gloves, can be used beyond their originally designed purpose. Increasingly these technologies and the means to programme them are finding their way into the hands of non-speci...</p>
