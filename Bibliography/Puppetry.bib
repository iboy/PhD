	Abstract = {Abstract
This paper describes a system that allows users to control virtual marionette characters based on computer graphics (CG marionette characters) with their hand and finger movements and thus perform a marionette theatrical play. The system consists of several subsystems, and each subsystem consists of a web camera and a PC. It can recognize a hand gesture of its user and transform it into a gesture of a CG marionette character. These subsystems are connected through the Internet, so they can exchange the information of the CG marionette character's movements at each subsystem and display the movements of all characters throughout the entire system. Accordingly, multiple users can join the networked virtual marionette theater and enjoy the marionette play together.
